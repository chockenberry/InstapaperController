InstapaperController
====================

This project contains a simple controller that lets you send URLs to an Instapaper account.

A sample project, Instapoopin, is included to show how this controller is used in an app. The `ViewController` is responsible for presenting an `AuthorizationViewController` when the `InstapaperController` needs the username/email and password. Everything else is handled by the `+sharedInstapaperController`.

The class is well documented in `InstapaperController.h`.
